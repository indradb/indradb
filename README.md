# [IndraDB](https://indradb.github.io) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/indradb/indradb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/indradb/indradb) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/indradb/indradb/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/indradb/indradb?branch=master)

A graph database written in rust. This software is in the alpha state.

## Features

* Support for directed and typed graphs.
* A simple, JSON-based query DSL with support for multiple hops.
* Multiple ways to work with the database:
    * Via HTTP API, and the clients that build off of it.
    * Via lua-based scripting.
    * By embedding IndraDB directly as a library.
* Support for metadata: key/value data tied to graph items that can be used for supporting things like caching results from graph processing algorithms executed offline.
* Pluggable underlying datastores, with built-in support for in-memory-only, [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [rocksdb](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb).
* Written in rust!

IndraDB's original design is heavily inspired by [TAO](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/courses/fall2013/static/papers/11730-atc13-bronson.pdf), facebook's graph datastore. In particular, IndraDB emphasizes simplicity of implementation and query langauge, and is similarly designed with the assumption that it may be representing a graph large enough that full graph processing is not possible. IndraDB departs from TAO (and most graph databases) in its support for metadata.

For more details, see the [homepage](https://indradb.github.io).

## Getting started

* [Download the latest release for your platform.](https://github.com/indradb/indradb/releases)
* Add the binaries to your `PATH`.
* Start the app: `indradb-server`

This should start an in-memory-only datastore, where all work will be wiped
out when the server is shutdown. You can persist your work with one of the
alternative datastores.

### In-memory

By default, IndraDB starts an in-memory datastore that does not persist to disk. This is useful for kicking the tires.

If you want to use the in-memory datastore, follow these steps:

* Start the server: `PORT=8000 indradb-server`
* Make a sample HTTP request to `http://localhost:8000`. Use a UUID with all
0's (i.e. `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) for the username, and no
password.

### Postgres

If you want to use the postgres-backed datastore, follow these steps:

* Create a database: `createdb indradb`
* Initialize the database schema: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/indradb indradb-admin init`
* Start the server: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/indradb PORT=8000 indradb-server`.
* Make a sample HTTP request to `http://localhost:8000`.

### RocksDB

If you want to use the rocksdb-backed datastore, follow these steps:

* Start the server: `DATABASE_URL=rocksdb://database.rdb PORT=8000 indradb-server`.
* Make a sample HTTP request to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Applications

There's two applications:

* `indradb-server`: For running the HTTP server.
* `indradb-admin`: For managing databases.

## Environment variables

Applications are configured via environment variables:

* `DATABASE_URL` - The connection string to the underlying database. Examples:
    * For a postgres datastore: `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/database-name`.
    * For a rocksdb datastore: `rocksdb://indradb.rdb`. This will store data in the directory `./indradb.rdb`.
* `PORT` - The port to run the server on. Defaults to `8000`.
* `SECRET` - The postgres implementation uses this as a [pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_%28cryptography%29) for increased security. Defaults to an empty string.
* `INDRADB_SCRIPT_ROOT` - The directory housing the lua scripts. Defaults to `./scripts`.

## Install from source

If you don't want to use the pre-built releases, you can build/install from source:

* Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). IndraDB should work with any of the rust variants (stable, nightly, beta.)
* Make sure you have gcc 5+ and postgres 9.5+ installed.
* Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:indradb/indradb.git`.
* Build/install it: `cargo install`.

## Running tests

Use `./test.sh` to run the test suite. Note that this will run the full test suite across the entire workspace, including tests for all datastore implementations. You'll need to have postgres running, since the postgres datastore depends on it.

You can filter which tests run via the `TEST_NAME` environment variable. e.g. `TEST_NAME=create_vertex ./test.sh` will run tests with `create_vertex` in the name across all datastore implementations.
