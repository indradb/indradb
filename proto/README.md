# IndraDB protos [![Docs](https://docs.rs/indradb-proto/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/indradb-proto)

This crate contains the IndraDB protobuf definitions, the autogenerated code from those definitions, and higher-level, more ergonomic client and server implementations. This crate is useful if you're wanting to interface with IndraDB from rust, without using the library (i.e. with a client/server relationship.) For example, see the [wikipedia indexer](https://github.com/indradb/wikipedia-example/tree/master).
