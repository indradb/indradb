//! The postgres datastore implementation.
//!
//! This should generally be considered by far the slowest implementation,
//! however it provides a few major benefits:
//!
//! * Transaction changes can be rolled back on error.
//! * Multiple `IndradB` server processes can run on the same datastore at the
//!   same time.
//! * You can use all of the postgres tooling to poke around at the results.
//! * Thanks to foreign keys et al., this is probably less buggy than other
//!   implementations.
