# IndraDB library [![Docs](https://docs.rs/indradb-lib/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/indradb-lib)

This is the IndraDB library. Most users can use the [server](https://github.com/indradb/indradb), which provides higher-level methods for working with IndraDB databases. Linking directly against the library would be necessary if you want to make a new datastore implementation, or if you want to work at a lower-level than the server affords.

## Pluggable datastores

IndraDB stores graph data in datastores. Datastores are pluggable: there is built in support for in-memory-only, postgres, and rocksdb, but you can implement a new custom datastore.

### In-Memory

To use the in-memory datastore, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.indradb-lib]
git = "https://github.com/indradb/indradb"
```

### Postgres

To use the postgres datastore, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.indradb-lib]
git = "https://github.com/indradb/indradb"
features = ["postgres-datastore"]
```

### RocksDB

To use the rocksdb datastore, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.indradb-lib]
git = "https://github.com/indradb/indradb"
features = ["rocksdb-datastore"]
```

### Custom datastores

To implement a custom datastore, you need to implement the [Datastore and Transaction traits](https://github.com/indradb/indradb/blob/master/lib/src/traits.rs). See the [in-memory datastore](https://github.com/indradb/indradb/blob/master/lib/src/memory/datastore.rs) for a simpler example implementation. To help you get off the ground faster, there is a standard test suite that can execute against any datastore and check for common bugs and regressions. See the [in-memory datastore tests](https://github.com/indradb/indradb/blob/master/lib/src/memory/tests.rs) for an implementation of it.

## Running tests
